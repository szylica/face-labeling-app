## Description
### A significant problem in the field of machine learning is datasets of facial images that are incorrectly labeled with emotions (bad labeling). Together with my team, we decided to create an application that, using a specially trained module, allows facial images to be reclassified based on the emotions they actually display. As input, users simply need to upload the JPG files they want to sort, and as output, they receive a ZIP file with the images sorted by emotion.
